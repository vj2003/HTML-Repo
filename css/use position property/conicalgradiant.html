    <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow
        from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. As of 2022, 2.16 million living
        animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and
        around 65,000 are vertebrates—but it has been estimated there are around 7.77 million animal species in total.
        Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex
        interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of
        animals is known as zoology.</p>
