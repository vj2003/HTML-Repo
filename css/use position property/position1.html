    <p>The concept of television is the work of many individuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The
            first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks
            to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an
            approximation of the original image. Development of television was interrupted by the Second World War.
            After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. Several
            different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed with different regions using
            technically incompatible signal standards. Television broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II,
            becoming an important mass medium for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment.</p>

        <p>Television broadcasts can be distributed over the air by VHF and UHF radio signals from terrestrial
            transmitting stations, by microwave signals from Earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to
            individual consumers by cable TV. Many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission
            methods and now use digital television standards, providing additional operating features and conserving
            radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. Television programming can also be distributed over the
            Internet.</p>

            height="200px" width="250px"></div>
       
        <p>Television broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long-haul microwave
            networks, which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. Video recording methods allow
            programming to be edited and replayed for later use. Three-dimensional television has been used commercially
            but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods.</p>
