    <p style="color: springgreen; font-size: larger; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">The German Shepherd is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899. It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep.<br>Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0531/2475/9744/files/1_1_2.jpg?v=1634102796" height="300px" width="500px">
    <p style="color: blueviolet;font-size: medium; font-style: unset;">The name Shih Tzu means “little lion,” but there’s nothing fierce about this dog breed. This pooch is a lover, not a hunter.

        Bred solely to be companions, Shih Tzus are affectionate, happy, outgoing house dogs who love nothing more than to follow their people from room to room. Since ancient times, they’ve made themselves comfortable on the laps of people from all walks of life, even emperors!<br>In recent years, however, pet parents have started taking Shih Tzus off their laps and into dog sports, training them for obedience, rally, and agility competitions. They make great family pets who get along with other animals and even children, so long as kids know how to gently handle and play with a small pup.</p>
