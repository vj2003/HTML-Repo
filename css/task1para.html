    <h1 style="color: red;">HONDA CITY IVTEC</h1>
    <p style="color: rgb(239, 251, 14);font-size: larger;font-style: italic;">The new L-Series SOHC i-VTEC engine in the 2009 Honda City is the same unit as found in the 2nd generation Honda Jazz. It produces 120 PS at 6,600rpm and 145Nm of torque at 4,800rpm, making it one of the most powerful 1.5 litre units today.<br>The first generation Honda City (not including the old little car that also came with a turbocharged engine) was designed as an ASEAN car that came with engines such as the 1.5 litre SOHC VTEC engine. It was quite a popular choice as a budget and “boxier” version of the Civic.</p>
    <p style="color: rgb(53, 216, 21);">Firstly, the doors open 80 degrees for easy access to the interior. In the interior, you get an instrument panel that is traditionally positioned behind the steering wheel. Good for those who dislike centrally-mounted instrument panels. There are two colour schemes – one beige and one black. Both will likely be used by Honda Malaysia, with the black for a high-spec or sports-specced version of the car and a beige one for the other. The black interior uses black for all the plastic parts while the fabric is in a purplish-black colour. The beige interior uses a grayish-beige tone for the plastic parts while the fabrics are done in beige with yellow overtones.</p>
